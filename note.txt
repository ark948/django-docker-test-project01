adding docker:
    - creating Dockerfile
    (fix the issue of whl files being in root dir - done)
    - create docker-compose.yml
    - run cmd> docker build .
    - run cmd> docker-compose up
    - navigate to 127.0.0.1:8000 to see the home page

adding PostgreSQL image to our Docker host:
    - postgres13 image must be pulled and present
    - add database adaptor (psycopg2-binary)
    (psycopg-binary will suffice for our project, for larger projects psycopg3 can be used)
    - add whl file to whl directory
    - update Dockerfile to copy and install whl file
    - update docker-compose.yml (add db service and a volume for data)
    - update django's settings.py to use PostgreSQL
    - run cmd> docker-compose up -d --build
    - visit home page
    - now run the migration to see if new database is working properly
    - docker-compose exec web python manage.py migrate
    - docker-compose exec web python manage createsuperuser
    - admin-admin@example.com-1
    (for these commands to work, cmd working dir must be in current project's dir)
    - check if admin user was created successfully
    - to bring containers down cmd> docker-compose down
